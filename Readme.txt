In this repository, I have collected my programming labs, which are preserved and workable.
Most of the programs and all reports that will be attached to the laboratory will be in Russian.
Most of the programs are written in C++ in Visual Studio 2019.
Now for navigation:
1) "Project build order" + command cmd
2) Programming languages
3) Learning cyclic algorithms
4) Handling one-dimensional arrays
5) STL template library
6) Handling two-dimensional arrays
